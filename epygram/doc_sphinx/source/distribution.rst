Maintenance & Obligations
-------------------------

The package is distributed without maintenance obligation from the authors nor CNRM/GMAP.

Every bug report, porting matter, or functionality improvement can be addressed

Furthermore, the package is supposed to evolve in a collaborative way. Feel

A Git repository together with a Redmine platform for project management shall
come soon (?) for that purpose. 

New releases will be distributed with the above conditions, with information
to be delivered by e-mail (?).
